# OmnAIView2.0.frontend

OmnAIView 2.0 is an Angular-based open-source Electron application designed for visualizing and controlling data captured by OmnAI diagnostic systems as well as analysing data via an integrated Diagnostic service. Diagnostic-services will be reachable through different REST-APIs and will be specialized on a lot of different purposes. It is an advanced iteration of the open-source project OmnAIView and the Front-End of the OmnAIView 2.0 application. 

In its initial iteration, the front-end is designed as a minimal viable product (MVP) for an oscilloscope user interface, offering fundamental mathematical analysis accessible through REST APIs.
